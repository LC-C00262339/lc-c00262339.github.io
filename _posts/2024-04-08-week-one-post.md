At the start of the project, I began by sketching things that I was already comfortable with. My first drawing was on January 8, a week before the semester began. It is a headshot sketch of Archen, a Pokémon species based on birds and avian dinosaurs.

After sketching, I found that the sketch was quite small and that some of the Archen's features were off. The back of Archen's head is blue, curving around the eye, while everything after the eye is red. In the sketch I made, Archen's eye is solely around the red area and never touches the blue curve. In addition, the back of the head is quite flat (I tried to compensate by making the lines thicker) and the bottom of the beak seemingly connects to nothing. These errors became a lot more noticable when I compared it to official artwork of the character.

I decided to redo the sketch the following day. I used a bigger circle for constructing the drawing than the previous one, as it would make the drawing stand out more and make it easier to fix any errors instead of starting from scratch.

This one is a vast immprovement over the first one. The eye now touches the curve instead of being in one area, the cracks on the beak and the teeth stand out, the back of the head is rounder, and the bottom of the beak now connects.
