Sketching Archen during Week 1 made me realize that I find birds fun to draw. They're simplistic and easy to construct, but look pretty and are quite diverse, so I decided to try draw a real species of bird this week. One project I want to focus on during the summer is adapting a poem into an animation, as animating is a great way of showing your artistic talents.

The bird I chose to draw next is an ovenbird, a small American warbler that resembles a thrush in appearance. While fairly plain in appearance, it would be significant for the aforementioned project as it happens to be featured in David Frost's "The Oven-Bird". In the poem, the ovenbird and its song are used as metaphors for the passage of time and how we respond to it. I enjoy the poem's themes and descriptions and feel that an animation of them would be a fun project to work on.

I drew two sketches of the bird - one standing, and the other in flight. Drawing the bird. Getting the anatomy right wasn't an issue, since it has a fairly straightforward circular shape, with two crescents for the wings. While I struggle with drawing feathers, I feel I got the rounded shape right. The tailfeathers should be bigger and less rectangular, and I should practice on trying to draw the feet when in flight. Nonetheless, these could easily be used in an animation.
