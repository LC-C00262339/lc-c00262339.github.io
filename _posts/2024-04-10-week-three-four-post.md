During week two, I made two sketches of an ovenbird inspired by David Frost's "The Oven-Bird", with the intention of using them in an animation. In the following two weeks, I decided to create two more assets I could use.

While I was busy researching my website design during week three, I found time to draw a black-eye Susan flower. I find this one interesting as it resembles a bigger, curvier daisy that could easily be mistaken for a sunflower.
