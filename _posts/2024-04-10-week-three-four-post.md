During week two, I made two sketches of an ovenbird inspired by David Frost's "The Oven-Bird", with the intention of using them in an animation. In the following two weeks, I decided to create two more assets I could use.

While I was busy researching my website design during week three, I found time to draw a black-eye Susan flower. I find this one interesting as it resembles a bigger, curvier daisy that could easily be mistaken for a sunflower.

I feel this drawing got the flower's anatomy right. The flower's petals are facing an angle and stand out without being entirely uniform, much like actual flowers. One detail I liked enough to add was the curved, potentially wilted petal that could fall off in an animation. This gives the drawing some character and fits the poem's theme about the passage of time. One thing I would fix are the flower's leaves, as I feel they could have been more oval in shape and seem more layered than they are here.

With a flower done, I moved onto a more complicated plant - a full tree. Trees are unique in how their branches can range from thin to thick, but they're quite complicated to get right. Some people opt just to draw a thick bark and pencil-thin branches, but I wanted to make a tree base that I could potentially stick petals or leaves on later.

This took a few days to create, but I'm quite happy with how it turned out. The branches have a consistent shape and the tree itself looks impressive. If I were to redraw this, I would try my hand at adding leaves, which would have to be added digitally as layering sketches is difficult.
