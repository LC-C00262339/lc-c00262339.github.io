One thing I've never gotten the hang of in art is perspective. Without proper perspective, a drawing can look flat and lifeless. Perspective's especially important when it comes to backgrounds and scenery, as you want the drawing's contents to stand out and have depth.

Since I drew some nature last week, I decided to draw a different environment instead. Bridges are fun to draw and look pleasing, especially one surrounded by hills and over a tunnel. I went onto Google Images and looked for something that fit the bill, and found an image on Wikimedia Commons to use as a reference.

Once I had an image to reference from, I sketched my own version of it. I added some details to be distinct, like brick outlines, and made the image closer than it appears. I also shaded the road and the tunnel with black to create the appearance of depth. Since I struggle with straight rectangles and layering such objects, I used a ruler to help.

I think this is a solid attempt at a background. You can clearly notice the hills overlapping the path to the tunnel, and the barriers overlapping the bridge's road. If I redrew this, I would try not to use a ruler to give myself a challenge and to get comfortable with making overlapping objects.
