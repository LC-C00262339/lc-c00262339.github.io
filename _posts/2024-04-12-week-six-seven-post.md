At the start of the project, I did sketches of a Pokémon's head. I feel it would be fitting to end this project by drawing a full body Pokémon, particularly a more animalistic one. And I decided to pick Mienfoo. Mienfoo has quite a lot of character, having baggy sleeves over its limbs, and a humanoid form, and I've always struggled with more humanoid forms.

As a warm-up, I did a sketch of Mienfoo's head. It is mostly true to the source material, but I made the ears more pointed and drew the insides, to make it more accurate to a real weasel. I felt I should have made the tufts of fur shorter in hindsight, something that I would do in the third sketch I made of it.

I then moved onto drawing the full body. There's not any references of Mienfoo with its arms rested besides fan art, so I tried my best to improvise.

When I finished the sketch, I felt disappointed by how stiff it seemed. I focused too much on making the body humanoid, only for it to turn out too muscular-looking, which made it look very uncanny to me. In addition, the construction is off - Mienfoo's torso should be a circle, not a trapezoid, and the arms seem to be puffy instead of being drooped sleeves. So I decided to try redraw it.

You can see the vast improvement here compared to the first. The body is rounder and cartoony while keeping a humanoid shape, with the sleeves and shirt drooping over the body. The legs are also symmetrical and feel animalistic, whereas the ones on my first felt too much like stiff knobs. I also like the head a lot, as I took my observations from the first drawing and implemented them here. The only change I would implement is making the neck less tall, as it sticks out too much. Overall, this is probably one of my favorite drawings that I've made recently, as it shows how much I can improve in just a little amount of time.
