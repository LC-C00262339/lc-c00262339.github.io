At the start of the project, I began by sketching things that I was already comfortable with. My first drawing was on January 8, a week before the semester began. It is a headshot sketch of Archen, a Pok√©mon species based on birds and avian dinosaurs. 

After sketching, I found that the sketch was quite small and that some of the Archen's features were off. The back of Archen's head is blue, curving around the eye, while everything after the eye is red. In the sketch I made, Archen's eye is solely around the red area and never touches the blue curve. In addition, the back of the head is quite flat (I tried to compensate by making the lines thicker) and the bottom of the beak seemingly connects to nothing.
