Sketching Archen during Week 1 made me realize that I find birds fun to draw. They're simplistic and easy to construct, but look pretty and are quite diverse, so I decided to try draw a real species of bird this week. One project I want to focus on during the summer is adapting a poem into an animation, as animating is a great way of showing your artistic talents.
