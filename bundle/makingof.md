<h2>Conceptualization</h2>

I came up with the idea of creating an art blog in January 2024. Around the start of the year I was struggling with art block and feared that I wasn't able to draw as well as I wanted to.

<h2>Researching and Visualizing</h2>

Initially, I planned for the blog to be made entirely using HTML and CSS. When I discussed the initial ideas with my lecturers, they felt that HTML on its own wasn't unique enough for a blog and suggested I look into different frameworks and software. One that stood out to me was Jekyll, a static site generator used for creating blogs. Jekyll hosts websites via GitHub Pages, which I have used previously.
